# Happy Coding
![Coverage](.github/badges/jacoco.svg)

Happy Coding is a challenge to help you acquire strong problem-solving skills by implementing solutions for **100 of the most popular algorithmic problems**.



## Description
This project contains more than 125 problems from w3resource.com and other sources and my solutions for them using the Java language.


For implementing the solutions, **I used Java features like data types, operators, control flow and data structures like arrays and two-dimensional arrays**.


These problems cover the most common problems in software development like computation, data transformation, data validation, data manipulation, searching and sorting.
The project also contains examples of recursion, binary search and sorting algorithms.


Solutions can be run with the help of the available unit tests. All solutions are covered by unit tests using scenarios from easy ones to the most complex ones.
