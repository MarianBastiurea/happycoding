# Happy Coding


  The Happy Coding was created to show my training in Java coding and
skills achieved during this time. Happy Coding can show to you my Java 
coding abilities an act as business card for me.

## Description


  My goal was to find a solution using Java for 100 problems from w3resource.com.
For that I used Java features like data types, operator, control flow,
arrays, two-dimensional array. These problems cover the most common
problems in programming. Like computation, transform, validation, array
manipulation, sorting. Also contains algorithm solving practices like 
recursion, sorting algorithms and searching algorithms. Solution can be
run with the help of unit testing. All solutions are covered by unit
testing using scenarios from easy ones to most complex ones.
