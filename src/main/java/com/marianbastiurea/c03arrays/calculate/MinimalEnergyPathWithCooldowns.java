Description:
You are a climber attempting to ascend a mountain, represented by an array heights of length n, where heights[i] indicates the height of the i-th platform.

You can move from platform i to any platform j > i, but each jump costs energy equal to abs(heights[j] - heights[i]). However, after making a jump, you must wait cooldown steps before you can jump again (i.e., you can only jump to j >= i + cooldown + 1).

Your goal is to reach the last platform (index n - 1) starting from platform 0 using any number of jumps, minimizing the total energy used.

Function Signature:
int minEnergyToReachEnd(int[] heights, int cooldown)
Example:
Input:
heights = [10, 30, 20, 40, 50], cooldown = 1

Output:
30

Explanation:
- Jump from 0 â†’ 2 (energy = |20 - 10| = 10)
- Wait 1 step â†’ jump from 2 â†’ 4 (energy = |50 - 20| = 30)
- Total = 10 + 30 = 40

But better:
- Jump from 0 â†’ 3 (energy = |40 - 10| = 30)
- Wait 1 â†’ jump from 3 â†’ 4 (|50 - 40| = 10)
- Total = **30 + 10 = 40**

But **best**:
- Jump from 0 â†’ 4 (|50 - 10| = **40**) â€” can't be better

Hmm, in this example all paths give the same. Try:

```java
Input: heights = [10, 13, 12, 15, 10], cooldown = 1

Best: 0 â†’ 2 (2), wait, 2 â†’ 4 (2) â†’ total = 4 âœ…
Constraints:
2 â‰¤ heights.length â‰¤ 10^4
0 â‰¤ heights[i] â‰¤ 10^4
0 â‰¤ cooldown < heights.length
ðŸ§© Hints:
Think of DP with a cooldown window.
A priority queue or segment tree can help optimize the minimum over sliding ranges.
Time complexity must ideally be O(n log n) or better â€” brute-force O(nÂ²) is too slow.
