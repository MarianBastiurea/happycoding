    /*
    You are given a flower garden represented as an array of n plots, numbered from 0 to n - 1. Each plot can be either empty or already contain a flower. You are provided with two inputs:

An array flowers of length n, where flowers[i] = 1 means there is already a flower in plot i, and flowers[i] = 0 means it is empty.
An integer k representing the number of new flowers you want to plant.
Important rule: You cannot plant a flower in a plot adjacent to another flower. That means if you plant a flower at position i, then positions i-1 and i+1 must be empty or out of bounds.

Task: Write a function that returns true if you can plant exactly k flowers without violating the adjacency rule. Otherwise, return false.

âœ… Example
Input: flowers = [1, 0, 0, 0, 1], k = 1
Output: true

Explanation: You can plant a flower at position 2 (0-based), with no adjacent flowers.
